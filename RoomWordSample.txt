IDEAS

Repository = manages different data sources
LiveData = observable data holder
Mental Model of whats going on 
Do the "Using Kotlin Coroutines in your Android App"

DAOS: offer methods to query database wihtout using the SQL
Room: 
 - Does not support queries on Main Thread
 - Asynchronous queries = return type LiveData, Flowable etc are run in a worker thread

Observers are the ones in active states??
they have a lifecycle?  NO, but they are attached to Lifecycle of the LifecycleOwners
